# Sync docs action

Files from the `developer-portal` folder should be synced in the following way:

1. Copy all contents of the `developer-portal` folder  to the [`/products`](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new/tree/master/products) folder in the [developer portal repo](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new)

   Note: Do not copy `product.yaml`, `service.yaml` and `api.yaml` files.

2. Process all `api.yaml` files following this [guide](#apiyaml-processing).
3. Process all `product.yaml`and `service.yaml` files following this [guide](#productyaml-and-serviceyaml-processing).

## api.yaml processing

For each `api.yaml` do:

1. Replace `api.yaml` with `<API_NAME>.page.yaml`. The new file should be created in the same folder where the original `api.yaml` was.

   `<API_NAME>` should be taken from the `name` field in the [`api.yaml` file](README.md#apiyaml-file)


2. The content of the `<API_NAME>.page.yaml` should be the following:

```yaml
type: reference-docs         # Hardcoded
definitionId: <API_NAME>      # Unique API identifier. Should be autogenerated using "name" field in the api.yaml file
settings:                    # Hardcoded
  generateCodeSamples:       # Hardcoded
    languages:               # Hardcoded
      - lang: curl           # Hardcoded
      - lang: JavaScript     # Hardcoded
      - lang: Node.js        # Hardcoded
      - lang: C#             # Hardcoded
      - lang: Java           # Hardcoded
```

3. Add `definitionId` from the `<API_NAME>.page.yaml` to the [`oasDefinitions` field](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new/blob/466042e062d95a6f2763969da3138f1b6058bca0/siteConfig.yaml#L16)  in the [`siteConfig.yaml`](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new/blob/master/siteConfig.yaml) of the Developer Portal:

Example:
```yaml
oasDefinitions:
  ...
  iam-api: https://iam-api.retailsvc.com/schemas/v1/openapi.json     
  <API_NAME>: specUrl       #Use specUrl field from the api.yaml file
```


## product.yaml and service.yaml processing

For each product folder:

1. Compile `product.yaml` and all `service.yaml` files into a single file called `sidebars.yaml`.

`sidebars.yaml` should be placed in the root of the [product](README.md#product-folder) folder in the Developer Portal _(assuming that the product folder was copied previously)_

2. The content of the `sidebars.yaml` should look like this:

```yaml
- label: <PRODUCT_NAME>         # "name" filed from the product.yaml
  page: index.md                # Hardcoded
  expanded: always              # Hardcoded
  pages:

     # A regular page is a Markdown document inside /developer-portal/PRODUCT_NAME/docs
     - label: DOC 1              # Title of the page 
       page: docs/doc1.md        # Path to the Markdown document
      ...

    # A group is a sub folder inside /developer-portal/PRODUCT_NAME/docs/...
    - group: Group              # Name of the sub folder 
      expanded: false           # Hardcoded
      pages:
       - label: GroupDoc 1                  # Title of the page (should be taken from the document content)
         page: docs/group/group-doc1.md     # Path to the Markdown document
    
    
    # Services section should be created for each product
    - group: Services         # Hardcoded
      expanded: true          # Hardcoded
      pages:
           
        # For each service.yaml file generate a service group    
        - group: Service1       # "name" filed from the service.yaml
          expanded: false       # Hardcoded
          page: services/service1/index.md          # Hardcoded
          pages:
           - label: Doc1                            # Title of the page (should be taken from the document content)
             page: services/service1/docs/doc1.md   # Path to the Markdown document
             ...

            # A group is a sub folder inside /developer-portal/PRODUCT_NAME/services/docs/...
           - group: Group              # Name of the sub folder 
             expanded: false           # Hardcoded
             pages:
                - label: GroupDoc 1                  # Title of the page (should be taken from the document content)
                  page: docs/group/group-doc1.md     # Path to the Markdown document

            # For each api.yaml file generate an api group
           - group: APIs              # Hardcoded
             expanded: true           # Hardcoded
             pages:
                - group: <API_NAME>
                  expanded: false
                  page: services/service1.apis/api1/index.md  # "rootDoc" field from the api.yaml
                  pages:
                     - label: API DOC 1              # Title of the page in the 
                       page: services/service1/apis/api1/docs/api-doc1.md        # Path to the Markdown document

                     - page: services/service1/apis/api1/api1.page.yaml          # API reference page
```
