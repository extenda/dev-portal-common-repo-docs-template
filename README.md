# Docs template repository

## Writing guide

### Audience
The audience is developers and non-engineers, both internal and external.


## Entity hierarchy

The diagram below represents entity hierarchy in the developer portal:

```
Developer Portal
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   docs   
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€Services
â”‚       â”‚  
â”‚       â”‚ docs
â”‚       â”‚ 
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€APIs 
â”‚           â”‚
â”‚           â”‚ references
â”‚           â”‚ 
```

### Product

The **Product** is the top-level entity of the Developer Portal

* A **Product** is a collection of **Services**.
* Each Product has its documentation written in markdown (.md), explaining how the underlying Services work.
* A Product may contain some marketing materials.
* The Product may contain multiple documents (.md files).
* The Product may contain both **public** and **private (internal)** docs.

### Service

* A **Service** is a collection of **APIs**.
* Each Service has its documentation written in markdown (.md), explaining how the underlying APIs work.
* The Service may contain multiple documents (.md files).
* The Service may contain both **public** and **private (internal)** docs.

### API

The **API** is the bottom level entity and an atomic building block of the Developer Portal. 

* APIs are documented using reference docs. API reference docs are automatically generated from the openapi spec file.
It means that you *do not need* to create separate docs (.md) for your APIs.
* **The documentation of the API is the openapi spec file, that follows Development Chapter guidelines**
* API documentation (reference docs) is always **public**




## File structure

To reflect [entity hierarchy](#entity-hierarchy) in your `<CLAN_NAME>-common` repository,
please follow these guidelines:

Note: In diagrams below "ðŸ“‚" marks folders


### Root folder
Your `<CLAN_NAME>-common` repository should contain a root `developer-portal` folder.
Files in the `developer-portal`
folder will be synced to the developer portal.


### Product folder
In your `developer-portal` folder create folders for each product, developed by your team.

```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â”‚  ... 
â”‚     
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 2 ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â”‚  ... 
```

For each product folder you have, do the following:

* Create `docs` folder to store `*.md` documentation
* Create `images` folder to store product-level images
* Create [`services`](templates/service.md) folder to store Service docs
* Create [`concepts.md`](templates/concepts.md) file, describing key concepts
* Create [`index.md`](templates/product.md) file. This file is the root doc of your product, containing a high-level overview.
* Create [`terminology.md`](templates/terminology.md) file to describe the terminology used by the product.
* Create `product.yaml` file. This file will be used to declare everything related to your product: its underlying services and their APIs.


Now, the file structure should look like this:

```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚ 
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   concepts.md
â”‚   â”‚   terminology.md
â”‚   â”‚   index.md
â”‚   â”‚   product.yaml
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€services ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 2 ðŸ“‚  
â”‚   ...
```



### Service folder
In your `services` folder create folders for each service, related to the product your team develops

```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚ 
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   concepts.md
â”‚   â”‚   terminology.md
â”‚   â”‚   index.md
â”‚   â”‚   product.yaml
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€services ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚     â”‚
â”‚   â”‚     â””â”€â”€â”€Service 1
â”‚   â”‚     â”‚
â”‚   â”‚     â””â”€â”€â”€Service 2
â”‚   â”‚     â”‚
```

For each service folder you have, do the following:

* Create `docs` folder to store `*.md` documentation
* Create `images` folder to store product-level images
* Create [`index.md`](templates/service.md) file. This file is the root doc of your service, containing a high-level overview.

Your final folder structure should look like this:


```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   concepts.md
â”‚   â”‚   terminology.md
â”‚   â”‚   index.md
â”‚   â”‚   product.yaml
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   doc1.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   doc2.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   ... 
â”‚   â”‚   
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   img1.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   img2.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   ... 
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€services ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚  
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€Service 1 ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚  
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚   index.md
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚   
â”‚       â”‚    â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    doc1.md
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    doc2.md
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    ...     
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    
â”‚       â”‚    â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    img1.png
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    img2.png
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    ...   
â”‚   
â”‚   
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 2 ðŸ“‚
    â”‚  
    â”‚  ...
```

## product.yaml file


`product.yaml` is the main file needed to add your docs to the Developer Portal. It defines products, services and APIs as well as how they should be displayed, which of them are private.

The structure of the product.yaml aimed at representing [entity hierarchy](#entity-hierarchy) of the Developer Portal:


```yaml
- name: PRODUCT_NAME                        # Name of the product
  shortName: pr1                            # Short name of the product
  description: string                       # Description of the product. Short and accurate
