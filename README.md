# Docs template repository

## Writing guide

### Audience
The audience is developers and non-engineers, both internal and external.


## Entity hierarchy

The diagram below represents entity hierarchy in the developer portal:

```
Developer Portal
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   docs   
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€Services
â”‚       â”‚  
â”‚       â”‚ docs
â”‚       â”‚ 
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€APIs 
â”‚           â”‚
â”‚           â”‚ references
â”‚           â”‚ 
```

### Product

The **Product** is the top-level entity of the Developer Portal

* A **Product** is a collection of **Services**.
* Each Product has its documentation written in markdown (.md), explaining how the underlying Services work.
* A Product may contain some marketing materials.
* The Product may contain multiple documents (.md files).
* The Product may contain both **public** and **private (internal)** docs.

### Service

* A **Service** is a collection of **APIs**.
* Each Service has its documentation written in markdown (.md), explaining how the underlying APIs work.
* The Service may contain multiple documents (.md files).
* The Service may contain both **public** and **private (internal)** docs.

### API

The **API** is the bottom level entity and an atomic building block of the Developer Portal. 

* APIs are documented using reference docs. API reference docs are automatically generated from the openapi spec file.
It means that you *do not need* to create separate docs (.md) for your APIs.
* **The documentation of the API is the openapi spec file, that follows Development Chapter guidelines**
* API documentation (reference docs) is always **public**


## File structure

To reflect [entity hierarchy](#entity-hierarchy) in your `<CLAN_NAME>-common` repository,
please follow these guidelines:

Note: In diagrams below "ðŸ“‚" marks folders


### Root folder
Your `<CLAN_NAME>-common` repository should contain a root `developer-portal` folder.
Files in the `developer-portal`
folder will be synced to the developer portal.


### Product folder
In your `developer-portal` folder create folders for each product, developed by your tribe.

```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â”‚  ... 
â”‚     
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 2 ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â”‚  ... 
```

For each product folder you have, do the following:

* Create `docs` folder to store `*.md` documentation of the product
* Create `images` folder to store product-level images
* Create `services` folder. You will define services related to your product in this folder
* Create [`concepts.md`](templates/concepts.md) file, describing key concepts
* Create [`index.md`](templates/product.md) file. This file is the root doc of your product, containing a high-level overview.
* Create [`terminology.md`](templates/terminology.md) file to describe the terminology used by the product.
* Create [`product.yaml`](#productyaml-file) file. This file will be used to declare everything related to your product: its underlying services and their APIs.

Now, the file structure should look like this:

```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚ 
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   concepts.md
â”‚   â”‚   terminology.md
â”‚   â”‚   index.md
â”‚   â”‚   product.yaml
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€services ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 2 ðŸ“‚  
â”‚   ...
```



### Service folder
In your `services` folder create folders for each service, related to the product your team develops

```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚ 
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   concepts.md
â”‚   â”‚   terminology.md
â”‚   â”‚   index.md
â”‚   â”‚   product.yaml
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â”‚ 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€services ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚     â”‚
â”‚   â”‚     â””â”€â”€â”€Service 1
â”‚   â”‚     â”‚
â”‚   â”‚     â””â”€â”€â”€Service 2
â”‚   â”‚     â”‚
```

For each service folder you have, do the following:

* Create `docs` folder to store `*.md` documentation
* Create `images` folder to store service-level images
* Create `apis` folder to store API docs for your service
* Create [`index.md`](templates/service.md) file. This file is the root doc of your service, containing a high-level overview.
* Create [`service.yaml`](#serviceyaml-file) file. This file will be used to declare everything related to your service: its underlying APIs, docs, ADR and architecture.

The folder structure should look like this:


```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   concepts.md
â”‚   â”‚   terminology.md
â”‚   â”‚   index.md
â”‚   â”‚   product.yaml
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   doc1.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   doc2.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   ... 
â”‚   â”‚   
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   img1.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   img2.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   ... 
â”‚   â”‚  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€services ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚  
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€Service 1 ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚  
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚   index.md
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚   service.yaml
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚   
â”‚       â”‚    â””â”€â”€â”€docs ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    doc1.md
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    doc2.md
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    ...     
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    
â”‚       â”‚    â””â”€â”€â”€images ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    img1.png
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    img2.png
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    ...   
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚  
â”‚       â”‚    â””â”€â”€â”€apis ðŸ“‚
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    
â”‚       â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    ...  
â”‚   
â”‚   
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 2 ðŸ“‚
    â”‚  
    â”‚  ...
```

### APIs folder

Finally, for each api folder do the following:

* Create `docs` folder to store `*.md` documentation of your API
* Create `images` folder to store api-level images
* Create [`api.yaml`](#apiyaml-file) file.

**Final folder structure** should look like this:

```
developer-portal ðŸ“‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Product 1 ðŸ“‚             //Product folder
â”‚   â”‚   concepts.md         //  Concepts

### Private docs

Developer portal allows you creating private docs. These docs will only be visible to authenticated Extenda users.

Use private docs to explain architecture, internals of the service and other information that shouldn't be exposed to external developers.

#### Private pages

If a page doesn't have any specific permission, that means the page will use the default permission from the rbac.yaml file. By default, all pages are publicly accessible.

When a permission is specified for a page, it is treated as a "required permission". That means all visitors must have the specified permission mapped to their role in order to access the page.
To set permissions for Markdown and MDX pages, add permission: `authenticated-user`to their front matter, for example:
```markdown
---
permission: authenticated-user
---

...
Content of the page
```

#### Private folders

You can set permissions for all pages (and other files like static assets) in any directory at once. To configure permissions for all files in a directory (group) and all its child directories (nested groups), create a `permissions.rbac.yaml` file in that directory.

The `permissions.rbac.yaml` must contain the permission: `authenticated-user` entry like in the example:

```yaml
permission: authenticated-user
```

### Groups

To group your Markdown documents on the UI, so that they appear in an expandable list, put them into a separate folder inside your `docs` folder.

The **name of the folder** will be used as a title for the dropdown on the UI.

You can create groups for **Products**, **Services** and **APIs**. Developer portal supports **nested groups**.

    â”‚  ...
```


## product.yaml file


`product.yaml` is the main file needed to add your docs to the Developer Portal. Use it to define product information

The structure of the `product.yaml`:


```yaml
- name: PRODUCT_NAME                        # Name of the product
  shortName: pr1                            # Short name of the product
  description: string                       # Description of the product. Short and accurate
  coverImage: ./images/PRODUCT_1.png        # Image link to be used as cover image of the product card in the Developer Portal
  rootDoc: index.md                         # Root doc (high-level overview) of the product. This document is the entry point documentation of the product. Must not contain internal information
  tags:                                     # Optional, helps to find the product faster on the "Products" page
    - tag1                                   
    - tag2
```


## service.yaml file


`service.yaml` is used to define a Service. 

The structure of the `service.yaml` is the same as for the `product.yaml` :


```yaml
- name: SERVICE_NAME                        # Name of the service
  shortName: svc1                           # Short name of the service
  description: string                       # Description of the product. Short and accurate
  coverImage: ./images/SERVICE_1.png        # Image link to be used as cover image of the product card in the Developer Portal
  rootDoc: index.md                         # Root doc (high-level overview) of the product. This document is the entry point documentation of the product. Must not contain internal information
  tags:                                     # Optional, helps to find the product faster on the "Products" page
    - tag1                                   
    - tag2
```


## api.yaml file

`api.yaml` is the file used to define an API of your service.

The structure of the `api.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: API_1                                     # Name of the API
shortName: api1                                 # Short name of the API
description: API_1 Description                  # Description of the product. Short and accurate
specUrl: https://test.com/openapi.json          # Link to the openapi spec file
tags:                                           # Optional, helps to find the API faster on the "APIs" page
  - tag1
  - tag2
```



# Sync docs action

Files from the `developer-portal` should be synced in the following way:

1. Copy all contents of the `developer-portal` folder  to the [`/products`](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new/tree/master/products) folder in the [developer portal repo](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new)
   
    Note: Do not copy `product.yaml`, `service.yaml` and `api.yaml` files.

2. Process all `api.yaml` files following this [guide](#apiyaml-processing). 
3. Process all `product.yaml`and `service.yaml` files following this [guide](#productyaml-and-serviceyaml-processing).





## api.yaml processing

For each `api.yaml` do:

1. Replace `api.yaml` with `<API_NAME>.page.yaml`. The new file should be created in the same folder where the original `api.yaml` was.
   
   `<API_NAME>` should be taken from the `name` field in the [`api.yaml` file](#apiyaml-file)


2. The content of the `<API_NAME>.page.yaml` should be the following:

```yaml
type: reference-docs         # Hardcoded
definitionId: <API_NAME>      # Unique API identifier. Should be autogenerated using "name" field in the api.yaml file
settings:                    # Hardcoded
  generateCodeSamples:       # Hardcoded
    languages:               # Hardcoded
      - lang: curl           # Hardcoded
      - lang: JavaScript     # Hardcoded
      - lang: Node.js        # Hardcoded
      - lang: C#             # Hardcoded
      - lang: Java           # Hardcoded
```

3. Add `definitionId` from the `<API_NAME>.page.yaml` to the [`oasDefinitions` field](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new/blob/466042e062d95a6f2763969da3138f1b6058bca0/siteConfig.yaml#L16)  in the [`siteConfig.yaml`](https://github.com/extenda/hiiretail-developer-docs-new/blob/master/siteConfig.yaml) of the Developer Portal:

Example:
```yaml
oasDefinitions:
  ...
  iam-api: https://iam-api.retailsvc.com/schemas/v1/openapi.json     
  <API_NAME>: specUrl       #Use specUrl field from the api.yaml file
```


## product.yaml and service.yaml processing

For each product folder:

1. Compile `product.yaml` and all `service.yaml` files into a single file called `sidebars.yaml`.

`sidebars.yaml` should be placed in the root of the [product](#product-folder) folder in the Developer Portal _(assuming that the product folder was copied previously)_

2. The content of the `sidebars.yaml` should be the following:

```yaml
- label: <PRODUCT_NAME>         # "name" filed from the product.yaml
  page: index.md                # "rootDoc" field from the product.yaml
  expanded: always              # Hardcoded
  pages:

     # A regular page is a Markdown document inside /developer-portal/PRODUCT_NAME/docs
     - label: DOC 1              # Title of the page 
       page: docs/doc1.md        # Path to the Markdown document
      ...

    # A group is a sub folder inside /developer-portal/PRODUCT_NAME/docs/...
    - group: Group              # Name of the sub folder 
      expanded: false           # Hardcoded
      pages:
       - label: GroupDoc 1                  # Title of the page (should be taken from the document content)
         page: docs/group/group-doc1.md     # Path to the Markdown document
    
    
    # Services section should be created for each product
    - group: Services         # Hardcoded
      expanded: true          # Hardcoded
      pages:
           
        # For each service.yaml file generate a service group    
        - group: Service1       # "name" filed from the service.yaml
